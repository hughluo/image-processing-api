# Image Processing API

## Usage
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm run build` to compile the code.
* Run `node ./dist/` to run the server.
* Put an image in assets folder and then resize the image. An example image `parrot.jpeg` is already put there, so try: http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=parrot.jpeg&width=300&height=300
